## Number of Islands (Leetcode)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: 
```
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
```
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```
**Output:** 3

## COUNT THE ISLANDS
Implement an algorithm which analyzes a two-color image and determines how many isolated areas of a single color the image contains.
Islands

An "island" is a set of adjacent pixels of one color (1) which is surrounded by pixels of a different color (0). Pixels are considered adjacent if their coordinates differ by no more than 1 on the X or Y axis.
